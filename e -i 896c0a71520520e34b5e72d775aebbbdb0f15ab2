    feat(ui): Redesign PrinterDetailView and standardize mod workflow

    This commit introduces a major redesign of the Printer Detail page to align its UI/UX with the rest of the application, creating a more consistent and modern user experience. The previous layout was a simple vertical stack, which resulted in wasted space on wider screens. The new design uses a responsive two-column grid with styled cards and headers.

    Additionally, the workflow for adding and editing printer mods has been refactored from modals into dedicated full-page views, standardizing the create/edit pattern across the entire application.

    Key changes include:

    -   **Redesigned PrinterDetailView Layout:**
        -   Replaced the single-column layout with a responsive two-column grid using styled cards.
        -   Consolidated "Printer Details" and "Notes" into a single card.
        -   Consolidated "Maintenance" and "Maintenance Notes" into another card.
        -   Standardized all button sizes on the page for visual consistency.

    -   **Standardized Mod Workflow:**
        -   Removed the "Add Mod" and "Edit Mod" modals.
        -   Created new dedicated views (`ModCreateView.vue`, `ModEditView.vue`) for a consistent full-page form experience.
        -   Created a reusable `ModForm.vue` component and standardized its styling to match other forms.

    -   **New "Download All" Feature for Mods:**
        -   Added a "Download All" button to each mod with files.
        -   Implemented a backend endpoint to zip and serve the files.
        -   Added a loading spinner to the button to provide user feedback during the download.

    -   **Code Hygiene & Bug Fixes:**
        -   Centralized common styles (`.form-control`, `.btn-delete-file`) into `main.css`.
        -   Added functionality to remove files from the upload queue in the mod form.
        -   Fixed various UI bugs, including input field autofill colors, file upload behavior, and text spacing.
    ```

    Implements a new notification type for low-stock consumable items and integrates it into a unified notification system.

    This commit introduces a new API endpoint (`/api/low-stock/`) to identify and serve inventory items that are marked as consumable and have a quantity at or below their defined threshold.

    The frontend has been updated to:
    - Move the notification bell from the sidebar to a new main header for better visibility and layout.
    - Fetch both maintenance reminders and low-stock alerts when the app loads.
    - Display both types of alerts in a categorized list within the notification modal.
    - Update the bell icon from an emoji to a cleaner SVG.
    - Update .gitignore to include additional local directories and modify service worker revision

    Additionally, this commit fixes two bugs in the maintenance reminders:
    - Corrects the navigation link to point to the correct `/printers/:id` URL.
    - Fixes the "Dismiss" button logic to properly clear the reminder date in the database.

    Improves the user experience during a data restore by providing clear visual feedback.

    Previously, clicking the final "Restore" button for a large backup file gave no indication that the process had started, potentially leading to user confusion or multiple clicks.

    This commit adds a loading state to the restore modal in the Settings view:
    - The "Permanently Restore Data" button is now disabled after being clicked.
    - The button text changes to "Restoring..." to show the process is active.
    - This state is managed with a `try...finally` block to ensure the button is re-enabled after the API call completes, whether it succeeds or fails.

    Increases the maximum file upload size to 250MB to support the restoration of large backup archives via the UI.

    The default Nginx limit of 1MB was causing "413 Request Entity Too Large" errors when uploading larger backup files. This commit raises the limit in both the Nginx proxy and the Django backend to ensure large files can be processed successfully.

    - `frontend/nginx.conf`: Sets `client_max_body_size` to 250m.
    - `backend/settings.py`: Sets `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` to the equivalent value in bytes.
